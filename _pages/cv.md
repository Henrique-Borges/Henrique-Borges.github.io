Education
======
* <b>PhD in Network Science</b>, Network Science Institute - Northeastern University, London, 2027 (expected)
* <b>MSc in Physics/Physics Engineering</b>, Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, 2023 (Grade: 17/20)
* <b>BSc in Physics/Physics Engineering</b>, Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, 2021 (Grade: 16/20)
* <b>Secundary Studies</b>, Escola Secundária de Vila Pouca de Aguiar, Vila Pouca de Aguiar, 2017 (Grade: 19/20)
  * <b>National Exams</b>: Physics and Chemistry - 190/200, Mathematics - 200/200

Research experience
======
* 2022-2023: <b>Master thesis, IST, Lisbon</b>
  * Project supervisors: F. L. Pinheiro and I. P. Lopes
  * In this work, we tried to understand how fast and to what extent individual rewiring preferences bridge initially weakly connected communities and how likely it is for them to reach a consensus, in a context of complex information diffusion.

* 2021-2022: <b>Research intern, CeFEMA-LaPMET, Lisbon</b>
  * Project supervisors: M. Gonçalves, E. Castro and P. Ribeiro
  * In this internship, we explored the topological properties of one-dimensional quasiperiodic structures. The research work is summarized in the following [recommendation letter](http://ulisboa-my.sharepoint.com/my?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fist190392%5Ftecnico%5Fulisboa%5Fpt%2FDocuments%2FPessoal%2FCV%20%2D%20MATERIALS%2FTopological%20Properties%20of%20Critical%20One%2DDimensional%20Quasiperiodic%20Structures%2FHenrique%5Fdeclaration%5Fsigned%5Fsigned%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fist190392%5Ftecnico%5Fulisboa%5Fpt%2FDocuments%2FPessoal%2FCV%20%2D%20MATERIALS%2FTopological%20Properties%20of%20Critical%20One%2DDimensional%20Quasiperiodic%20Structures&ga=1.com).

* 2019: <b>Research intern, LIP, Lisbon</b>
  * Project supervisors: M. Araújo, P. Faccioli and J. Seixas
  * In this internship, we measured the polarization of prompt J/ψ mesons in proton-proton collisions at √s = 8 TeV, using a dimuon data sample collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The project culminated in a [public presentation](https://indico.lip.pt/event/601/contributions/1957/attachments/1715/2200/onia.pdf) and lead to the writing of a [working paper](https://espace.cern.ch/lip/pub/docs/LIP-STUDENTS-19-05.pdf).
