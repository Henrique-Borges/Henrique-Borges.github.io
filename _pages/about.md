I am a PhD candidate in Network Science working under [Prof. Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io) in the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org) at [Northeastern University London](https://www.nulondon.ac.uk). 

I am a physicist with a focus in applied sciences and my research interests lie at the intersection of network science, statistical physics, data science, and dynamical systems. By combining empirical methods (designing of laboratorial experiments and data analysis of both experiments and real-life data) with theoretical approaches (analytical and computational modeling of multi-agent systems), I aim to explore the emergent properties of complex systems. 

In my [PhD project](https://www.nulondon.ac.uk/faculty/henrique-borges), I seek to understand the origin and impact of group interactions on coordination, communication, and decision-making. At the moment, I am trying to understand how social behavior in animal groups is determined by the genetic toolbox, and how groups coordinate to make decisions in naturalistic settings.

In parallel, I am actively working as part of [Project CETI](https://www.projectceti.org/about#story). In particular, I am working on a recent dataset on the social dynamics and decision making of a sperm whale clan during the birth of a calf (the first one being recorded live with drone video and acoustic recordings from hydrophones).

Previously, I received a [BSc](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/left21) and [MSc](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meft21) in Physics/Physics Engineering in 2021 and 2023, from [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). During my [Master Thesis](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meft21/dissertacao/1972678479055565), I focused on studying how social networks affect the dynamical processes underlying the difussion of information, opinions and behaviors. I tried to understand how individual rewiring preferences bridge initially weakly connected communities and how likely it is for them to reach a consensus, in a context of complex information diffusion.
