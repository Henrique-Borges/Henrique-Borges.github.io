A new paper on "How social rewiring preferences bridge polarized communities" was accepted in [Chaos, Solitons and Fractals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077924001450). In this paper we studied how individual rewiring preferences bridge initially weakly connected communities and how likely it is for them to reach a consensus, in a context of complex information diffusion.
