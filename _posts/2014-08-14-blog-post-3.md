I joined the newly launched hub of the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org) at [Northeastern University London](https://www.nulondon.ac.uk) as a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io).

My PhD project, "Coordination, Communication and Decision Making in Human and Non-Human Social Groups", aims to delve into the origin and effect of groups on social and coordination dynamics, employing an interdisciplinary approach that integrates data from genetic samples and animal behaviour observations, face-to-face interactions, digital social traces, and animal communication records. 
Additionally, we will explore information theoretic descriptions of group behaviour to uncover emergent patterns, causal decoupling, and the concept of downward causation.
