 I participated in [Hypergraphs: Theory and Application](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/hta/), a 4-week-long satellite programme, held at the Alan Turing Institute, that invited pure and applied mathematicians working at the forefront of hypergraph theory, applied topology and network science to interact with each other to further develop the foundations of hypergraph theory and applications across the sciences.
