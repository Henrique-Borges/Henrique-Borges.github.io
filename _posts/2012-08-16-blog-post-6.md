I was accepted to IPAM's Workshop [Modeling Multi-Scale Collective Intelligences](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/workshop-iv-modeling-multi-scale-collective-intelligences/) at Los Angeles, a 1-week-long satellite workshop, part of the long program [Mathematics of Intelligences](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/mathematics-of-intelligences/) held at IPAM, that invited leading experts in the mathematical modeling of collective intelligence to develop the mathematical foundations necessary for transformational advances in understanding natural and artificial intelligences.
